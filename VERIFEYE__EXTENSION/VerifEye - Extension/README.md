## How It Works

The extension uses a multi-layered approach to analyze webpages:

1. **Domain Analysis**
   - Checks for typosquatting (similarity to popular domains)
   - Analyzes TLD reputation
   - Verifies HTTPS implementation

2. **Code Analysis**
   - Scans for obfuscated and potentially malicious JavaScript
   - Detects hidden elements that may contain malware
   - Identifies suspicious event handlers and redirects

3. **Content Analysis**
   - Identifies disinformation keywords and patterns
   - Detects clickbait and social engineering tactics
   - Analyzes text for urgency, fear, and reward language

4. **Phishing Detection**
   - Identifies login forms and credential collection
   - Detects brand impersonation attempts
   - Analyzes forms for sensitive data collection

5. **Privacy Analysis**
   - Identifies tracking scripts and fingerprinting techniques
   - Analyzes cookie usage and local storage
   - Detects excessive data collection

6. **Network Analysis**
   - Checks for mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS pages)
   - Analyzes external resource domains
   - Identifies suspicious network patterns

The extension calculates a comprehensive risk score based on these analyses and determines the overall risk level of the webpage.

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla JavaScript for maximum performance
- Uses advanced pattern matching and heuristic algorithms
- Implements caching to avoid rescanning recently visited pages
- All analysis happens locally in your browser for privacy
